# SudokuSolver
Overview
This project is a Sudoku Solver built using Python and the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle, solve it, and display the solution. If no solution is possible for the provided puzzle, a message will inform the user of that.
Features
•	Sudoku Puzzle Solver: Automatically solves the input puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
•	Graphical User Interface: A user-friendly interface for inputting values into a Sudoku grid.
•	Clear Button: Resets the entire board to blank.
•	Color-Coded 3x3 Boxes: 3x3 subgrids are highlighted with a light green background for better visual clarity.
•	Error Handling: Displays a message if the Sudoku puzzle has no valid solution.
Requirements
•	Python 3.x
•	Tkinter (Tkinter is usually included with Python installations, but if it's not, you can install it using the package manager for your system.)
How to Use
1.	Start the application: Run the Python script using the following command:
2.	Enter a Sudoku puzzle:
o	The grid consists of 9x9 cells where each cell represents a Sudoku board position.
o	Enter numbers between 1 and 9 for the given positions, and leave blank the cells where you want the solver to fill in the numbers.
o	Click on the Solve button to solve the puzzle.
3.	View the solution:
o	If a valid solution exists, the grid will be filled in with the solution to the puzzle.
o	If no solution exists, a message box will pop up indicating that the puzzle cannot be solved.
4.	Clear the board: You can click the Clear button to reset the grid and start over with a new puzzle.
Backtracking Algorithm
This Sudoku solver uses the backtracking algorithm, a form of depth-first search. The algorithm works as follows:
1.	Find the next empty spot (cell with value 0).
2.	Try placing each number from 1 to 9 in that cell.
3.	Check if placing a number is valid (no conflicts in the current row, column, or 3x3 subgrid).
4.	If placing a number results in a valid board, recursively try to solve the rest of the puzzle.
5.	If a number doesn't lead to a solution, backtrack by resetting the cell and trying the next number.
6.	If all cells are filled, the puzzle is solved.
Notes
•	Sudoku Rules: In Sudoku, the board is divided into 9x9 cells, which are further divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. The objective is to fill the grid such that:
o	Each row contains the numbers 1 through 9 without repetition.
o	Each column contains the numbers 1 through 9 without repetition.
o	Each 3x3 subgrid contains the numbers 1 through 9 without repetition.
•	The provided backtracking algorithm may not be the most efficient solution for extremely difficult puzzles, but it works for typical Sudoku puzzles.
